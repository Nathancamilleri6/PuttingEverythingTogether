# PuttingEverythingTogether

Remove .html from the url
Project to have multiple tags and assignees (to have junction tables) (many to many rels)
Fix delete comments
Fix assign users to projects (users are currently automatically assigned when created (i think) ) 
	- Only show the user projects they are assigned to or ones they created
Use refresh token in front-end when recieving a 401 error
Add CSS
Show errors in front end (example when login is invalid, when registering with already existing email, etc)


Project structuring: 
	- Put interfaces in domain and repositories in data
	- JS files to be seperated from site.js and split into api specific files and function specific files
